# Web Scraping Project

For this project I'll be scraping the first page of Hacker News and displaying the results in a html file. I'll only be retrieving the articles with 100 votes and over and displaying them in descending order. I've created a simple style sheet as well to display the results in a nicer responsive grid layout.

Assuming you have python and pip installed:

1. Install `pip install beautifulsoup4` which is a library for scraping the web.

2. Install `pip install requests` which will allow us to retrieve the html files.

3. Run `python scrape.py`

4. Open index.html in browser to view results.

Here is a sample page after running the script on 07/07/2020 https://freedamoore.github.io/python-scraping-hacker-news
