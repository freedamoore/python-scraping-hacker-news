# Web Scraping Project

For this project I'll be scraping hacker news

Assuming you have python and pip installed:

1. Install `pip install beautifulsoup4` which is a library for scraping the web.

2. Install `pip install requests` which will allow us to retrieve the html files.

3. Run `python scrape.py`

4. Open index.html in browser to view results.
